# SOS Project 2017

Under heavy WIP

## Noteworthy stuff

* logicElements.sensor.SocketIOSensor is currently the entry point then the data is piped through the different classes
* logicElements.monitor.Monitor
* logicElements.analyzer.SocketIOSensor
* logicElements.sensor.Analyzer
* logicElements.planner.Planner
* logicElements.executor.Executor
* logicElements.effector.SocketIoEffector - output here 

Please keep in mind this is currently evaluating the framework and what is possible with it. The class names are very likely to be renamed and mock data to be added.

Maybe also a client project will be created to send some fake data to the system.
